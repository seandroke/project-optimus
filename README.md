# Project Optimus

## Description

Project Optimus is a home development server. The conception of this idea came when faced with the challenges of having to choose a hosting platform
for a school project. Said school project was a full stack applicaiton with a front and back end alongside a NoSQL database. I initially chose to host on Amazon's EC2
as it promised auto scalibility but after a few weeks of 7+ developers executing code, I was facing a rather hefty bill. Enter Optimus...
<br /><br />
Optimus is an old gaming PC I had decomissioned as I seldom had time to use it. The specifications of this machine can be found in the documentation,
but suffice to say, it is substantially more performant than the EC2 instance we were paying for. As a result, I turned it into a development Linux server
and for the rest of college and beyond it now serves as a permanent development environment for my personal projects and continued research.
<br /><br />
As of May 2020, I am currently researching the use cases of highbrid cloud computing, maximizing the capability of on premises hardware with the benfits of AWS
scalability for optimal price/performance ratios in relation to big data (Hadoop, Spark, etc.) In the near future, I will be publishing this research as part of
my personal website available at <a target="_blank" href="seandroke.com">http://seandroke.com</a>.

<strong><i>A warning for anyone looking for source code, this project is mainly DevOps/SysAdmin related. There may be the inclusion of
a few scripts helpful in the setup process but this project mostly serves as a means for me to maintain versionality.</i></strong>
